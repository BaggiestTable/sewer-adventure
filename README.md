This is a game project I made as part of my final project in my Programming 1 class.

It is a silly adventure game where you type directions and instructions into the terminal to traverse a fictional world.

There are a few different ways to beat the game.

I provided some playthroughs in case you want to get through 
the game in as little time as possible or in case you get stuck.

Inspired by [Colossal Cave Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure). You can try playing that game [here](https://rickadams.org/adventure/advent/).
