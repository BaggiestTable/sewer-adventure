This is a game project I made as part of my final project in my Programming 1 class.

I was inspired by Colossal Cave Adventure to create this.

It is a silly adventure game where you type directions and instructions to traverse a fictional world.

There are a few different ways to beat the game.

I provided some playthroughs in case you want to get through 
the game in as little time as possible or if you get stuck.

just run main.py to start playing!
