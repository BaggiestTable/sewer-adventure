This is a game project I made as part of my final project in my Programming 1 class.

It is a silly adventure game where you type directions and instructions to traverse a fictional world.

There are a few different ways to beat the game.

I provided some playthroughs in case you want to get through 
the game in as little time as possible or if you get stuck.

just run main.py to start playing!

Inspired by [Colossal Cave Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure). You can try playing that game [here](https://rickadams.org/adventure/advent/).
