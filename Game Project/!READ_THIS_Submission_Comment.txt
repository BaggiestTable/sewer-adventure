I chose to make a choice based dungeon crawler like Colossal Cave Adventure with portals.
I made an adventure game not really based around a certain area.
I added a "portal" where you can dig with the shovel to skip a section of the game (sewer and maze).

I provided some playthroughs in case you want to get through 
the game in as little time as possible or if you get stuck.

just run main.py to start playing!
